Domain Randomisation (DR) is concerned with the creation of generating synthetic datasets to
overcome the challenges of collecting real-world image datasets. This project assesses DR as a means
to generate image datasets of rendered CAD models, for the use in Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) based upon object detection of CAD models. A literature review was conducted that
identified the typical domains to be randomised, where ‘domain’ refers to randomisable attributes
within the image, to get as close to real-world variability as possible. A dataset was generated, and a
bespoke CNN model was trained on this synthetic dataset through hyper-tuning using state of the art
hyperparameter optimisation methods. Results indicate the strength of CNNs in image classification
tasks but illustrate the shortcomings of generalisation towards different paradigms. The results show
that an approach based on DR best practices was not able to overcome the sim-2-real transfer of
learning, highlighting the need for future work. This project stands as a baseline reference for
generating a DR compliant dataset of high quality, provides strong CNN hyperparameter methods and
introduces newer object identification technologies that may serve useful in future experimentation.
The report concludes with a discussion on insights into future research efforts that may allow for the
use of the technique with different approaches.
